# Automated Crypto Scripts

# What is it?
These are a set of automated Python scripts that pull data from the cryptocurrency exchange site 
CryptoCompare(https://www.cryptocompare.com) via their supplied API. 

# How does it work?
Using python, I access the cryptocurrency exchange site via their API and extract current cryptocurrency prices as well as
historical data for individual crypto currencies. These Python scripts decode the data from the API and saves it as a json 
file locally on your system to be accessed by other scripts or for your personal use.

# What can it be used for?
These scripts can be used to automatically track cryptocurrency prices in real time and compare cryptocurrencies historically against
one another over time. These scripts can be used as part of a Cryptocurrency exchange site, 
to make decisions to invest in certain cryptocurrencies or for your own personal cryptocurrency related projects.
